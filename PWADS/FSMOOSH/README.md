# FIREBAAT's SMOOSH
- The datafiles have been stripped out of these .pk3s for compliance purposes
- Open the files ending in _E with 7zip, SLADE or some other archive manager.
  - Put associated files from WADSMOOSH into /maps
  - WadSmoosh can be found here https://jp.itch.io/wadsmoosh
  - Remove the _E from the file name
  - For FMASTER_E.pk3, place in the Master Level .WADs
  - If you wish, extract Bad Dream from TEETH.WAD, and bundle it into TEETH2.WAD.
  - You should be able to play TEETH and the rest of the levels normally even if you don't

## RUNNING
- Use freedoom1.wad as the iwad
- Import:
  - brutalv21.pk3, (just use wadsmoosh if you don't want to play BrutalDOOM)
  - freedoom2.wad, (level names will conflict if freedoom1 & 2 are not loaded first)
  - DOOM.WAD, SIGIL_V1_21.WAD, SIGIL_II_V1_0.WAD,
  - DOOM2.WAD, NERVE.WAD, TNT.WAD, and PLUTONIA.WAD
